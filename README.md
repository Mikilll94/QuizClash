<b>Short description</b>

ASP .NET server and Android application client.
Version of app for first sprint available [a here](https://appetize.io/app/bahnr8e1p0c4kgj94hrhq6zyfm?device=nexus5&scale=75&orientation=portrait&osVersion=7.0)

<b>Comunicating app with a .net server on localhost</b>

- both device and computer must be in the same network (set as home network)
- tutorial [a here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29016760/visual-studio-2013-debug-using-ip-address-instead-of-localhost)
differences: if your windows is polish, 'user=wszyscy' instead of 'user=everyone'
- don't forget to add an incoming rule to firewall (in my case port is 50346)
